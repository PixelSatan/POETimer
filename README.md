# PoE Speedrun Timer  

A simple speedrun timer for Path of Exile.  
This is my first project, and I'm still learning programming, so the functionality is quite basic for now.  

## Features:
- Start and reset the timer  
- Capture split times  
- Adjust window transparency  
- Read game logs (if the correct path is set)  

## How to Run:
1. Download the `.exe` file (if available in releases).  
2. Set the correct path to Path of Exile logs.  
3. Start the timer and explore locations!
